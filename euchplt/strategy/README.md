# Strategy

This module provides classes that implement bidding and playing strategies for players
and teams.  Note that `Strategy` (abstract base class) can also be subclassed by other
modules for special purpose use (e.g. "traversal" strategies in the `ml` module).

## Classes

### Strategy

Abstract base class, cannot be instantiated directly.  Subclasses should be instantiated
using `Strategy.new(<strat_name>)`.

Subclasses must implement the following methods:

- `bid()`
- `discard()`
- `play_card()`
- `notify()` â€“ *\[optional]* handle notifications (e.g. `DEAL_COMPLETE`)

The context for all calls is provided by `DealState`, which is defined as follows (in
euchre.py):

```python
class DealState(NamedTuple):
    pos:              int
    hand:             Hand
    turn_card:        Optional[Card]
    bids:             list[Bid]
    tricks:           list[Trick]
    contract:         Optional[Bid]
    caller_pos:       Optional[int]
    go_alone:         Optional[bool]
    def_alone:        Optional[bool]
    def_pos:          Optional[int]
    played_by_suit:   dict[Suit, Hand]
    unplayed_by_suit: dict[Suit, set[Card]]
    tricks_won:       list[int]
    points:           list[int]
    player_state:     dict
```

### StrategyRandom

Randomly pick between valid bids, discards, and card plays.  Note that there are a
number of magic numbers hardwired into the implementation (e.g. thresholds for whether
or when to bid, go/defend alone, etc.), which we may want to parameterize for some
visibility (this is, after all, a teaching tool).

### StrategySimple

Represents minimum logic for passable play--very basic strategy, fairly
conservative (though we add several options for more aggressive play).

`aggressive` parameter (int) bit fields (can be OR'ed together):

- `0x01` - partner is winning, but play high (pre-emptive) from the third seat rather than
  duck
- `0x02` - take high (if possible) from second or third seat, rather than lower take
  (e.g. use A instead of Q on a lead of 9)

TODO (maybe): parameterize some of the magic numbers in this code!?!?

### StrategySmart

Strategy based on rule-based scoring/strength assessments, both for bidding and
playing.  The rules are parameterized, so variations can be specified in the config
file.

#### Bidding

Example parameter values for bidding:

```yaml
  hand_analysis:    # keep this empty here, but may be overridden by
                    # individual strategies
  turn_card_value:  [10, 15, 0, 20, 25, 30, 0, 50]
  turn_card_coeff:  [25, 25, 25, 25]
  bid_thresh:       [35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35]
  alone_margin:     [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  def_alone_thresh: [35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35]
```

Brief description of bid parameters:

- `hand_analysis` - override base config parameters for `HandAnalysisSmart`
- `turn_card_value` - value for turn card, indexed by rank (9-R, e.g. A = 30, above)
- `turn_card_coeff` - multiplier for `turn_card_value`, indexed by seat position
  (product to be added to hand strength)
- `bid_thresh` - total strength needed to bid, indexed by bid position (across 2
  rounds)
- `alone_margin` - margin above `bid_thresh` needed to go alone, indexed by bid
  positions
- `def_alone_thresh` - total strength needed to defend alone, indexed by bid
  position

FUTURE: there is an opportunity to build a framework for optimizing the various
parameters, either in an absolute sense, or possibly relative to different opponent
profiles.  In the mean time, see `tune_strategy_smart()` as a tool to aid in manual
tuning.

#### Playing

Playing strategy is implemented using a number of individual play "tactics", or card
selection criteria applicable to a particular circumstance and/or objective, which may
or may not pertain to the current deal context.  These tactics are organized into
"rulesets", which are lists of method calls that are tried in sequence until one of
them returns a result (i.e. a card to play).  There are distinct rulesets for the
following play situations within a deal:

- Initial lead (first trick)
- Subsequent leads
- Partner winning (current trick)
- Opponent winning (current trick)

The rulesets are defined in the base_config.yml file (and overridable for individual
strategies in strategies.yml).  Here is an excerpt from the base configuration:

```yaml
  subseq_lead:
    - lead_last_card
    - draw_trump
    - lead_off_ace
    - lead_to_partner_call
    - lead_suit_winner
    - lead_to_create_void
    - lead_low_non_trump
    - lead_low_from_long_suit
  part_winning:
    - play_last_card
    - follow_suit_low
    - throw_off_to_create_void
    - throw_off_low
    - play_low_trump
    - play_random_card
```

The methods that implement the play tactics are contained (and documented) in the
[`_PlayCard`](https://crashka.github.io/euchre-plt/_build/html/euchplt.html#euchplt.strategy._PlayCard)
class.  This class also maintains a "play plan" (with tags such as `DRAW_TRUMP` or
`PRESERVE_TRUMP`) that can be dynamically managed and helps direct the execution within
the tactics.

### StrategyML

Invocation of ML-based strategies, created by the framework defined in [ml/](../../ml).

### StrategyRemote

Invocation of remote strategies through the
[EuchreEndpoint](https://github.com/crashka/EuchreEndpoint) interface.
